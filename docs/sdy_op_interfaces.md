# OpInterface definitions
## ShardableDataFlowOpInterface (`ShardableDataFlowOpInterface`)

An op interface that allows shardy to add data flow edges to propagate
shardings for:
  1. Between ops that extend this op interface and other ops and
  2. Within the region (if any) of ops that extend this op interface.

Each data flow edge has an owner, a set of targets and a set of sources.
If the sharding of the targets change, the sharding of the sources should
be updated accordingly and vice versa.
An owner is a user specified target of the data flow edge used by shardy's
propagation. The user can choose it arbitrarily but it needs to be static.

### Methods:
#### `getBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerShardings`

```c++
mlir::ArrayRef<mlir::sdy::TensorShardingAttr> getBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerShardings();
```
Returns the shardings of all block argument data flow edge owners.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerSharding`

```c++
void setBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerSharding(unsigned index, mlir::sdy::TensorShardingAttr sharding);
```
Sets the shardings of the block argument edge owner with the given index.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `setBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerShardings`

```c++
void setBlockArgumentEdgeOwnerShardings(mlir::ArrayRef<mlir::sdy::TensorShardingAttr> shardings);
```
Sets shardings of all block argument edge owners.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getBlockArgumentEdgeOwners`

```c++
mlir::ArrayRef<mlir::BlockArgument> getBlockArgumentEdgeOwners();
```
Gets all block argument edge owners.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getOpResultEdgeOwners`

```c++
mlir::ResultRange getOpResultEdgeOwners();
```
Gets all op result edge owners.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getSources`

```c++
mlir::SmallVector<mlir::Value> getSources(mlir::Value target);
```
Gets the data flow edge sources given a target value.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getEdgeOwner`

```c++
mlir::Value getEdgeOwner(mlir::Value target);
```
Gets the owner target of a data flow edge given a target that may or may not be the owner.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `getEdgeOwnerFromSource`

```c++
mlir::Value getEdgeOwnerFromSource(mlir::OpOperand&source);
```
Gets the owner target of a data flow edge given a source.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

## ShardingRuleOpInterface (`ShardingRuleOpInterface`)

An op interface that allows the op to define its own sharding rule.
A sharding rule specifies how an operation can be partitioned according to
various properties on the op - any attributes, the shape of operands,
the shape of the results, etc. See `OpShardingRuleAttr` for more
details.

### Methods:
#### `getShardingRule`

```c++
mlir::sdy::OpShardingRuleAttr getShardingRule();
```
Returns the sharding rule of the op.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.
