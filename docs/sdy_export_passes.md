### `-sdy-sharding-constraint-to-reshard`

_Converts ShardingConstraintOp into ReshardOp._

### `-sdy-sink-data-flow-edges`

_Sinks all `DataFlowEdgeOp` into their input._

Moves the sharding of each `DataFlowEdgeOp` to its input (the root target of
the edge), and replaces the op with its input.

TODO(tomnatan): consider moving the sharding to all targets that can have a
sharding attached.
### `-sdy-update-non-divisible-input-output-shardings`

_Makes FuncOp inputs/outputs evenly sharded, removing any need for padding due to non-divisible shardings._

Users of Shardy expect the function inputs/outputs to be evenly
divisible/shardable to avoid requiring padding their tensors. Propagation
may make inputs/outputs have non-divisible shardings, so this pass updates
them to the largest dimension sharding prefix of the original sharding that
is evenly sharded.
