### `-sdy-sharding-constraint-to-reshard`

_Converts ShardingConstraintOp into ReshardOp._

### `-sdy-sink-data-flow-edges`

_Sinks all `DataFlowEdgeOp` into their input._

Moves the sharding of each `DataFlowEdgeOp` to its input (the root target of
the edge), and replaces the op with its input.

TODO(tomnatan): consider moving the sharding to all targets that can have a
sharding attached.
