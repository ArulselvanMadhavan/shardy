### `-sdy-aggressive-propagate`

_Runs the aggressive sharding propagation algorithm._

Propagate shardings with an aggressive factor propagation strategy. The
basic strategy only propagates shardings without conflicts, while the
aggressive strategy resolves conflicts. Higher aggressiveness can reduce the
memory footprint at the cost of potential communication.

**Options:**
- `-keep-sharding-rules`: whether to keep existing and created op sharding
   rules.
- `-module-dump-directory`: where to dump any rewritten modules for debugging.
- `-conservative-propagation`: whether to disallow split axes and non-divisible
   sharding axes during propagation.
- `-debug-sharding-origins`: whether to save information about the origin of a
   sharding on the MLIR module. These would be the shardings on the function
   inputs, outputs, sharding constraints and manual computations before
   propagation.
- `-debug-edge-source-sharding`: whether to save information about the edge source
   of a sharding on the MLIR module. These are what operand/result introduced a
   sharding on some op result.
- `-propagation-strategy`: which factor propagation strategy to use.
### `-sdy-basic-propagate`

_Runs the basic sharding propagation algorithm._

The basic propagation algorithm is the lowest strategy of propagation in the
hierarchy, that doesn't do any conflict resolution, and instead propagates
axes that are compatible between all operands and results.

**Options:**
- `-keep-sharding-rules`: whether to keep existing and created op sharding
  rules.
- `-module-dump-directory`: where to dump any rewritten modules for debugging.
- `-conservative-propagation`: whether to disallow split axes and non-divisible
   sharding axes during propagation.
- `-debug-sharding-origins`: whether to save information about the origin of a
   sharding on the MLIR module. These would be the shardings on the function
   inputs, outputs, sharding constraints and manual computations before
   propagation.
- `-debug-edge-source-sharding`: whether to save information about the edge source
   of a sharding on the MLIR module. These are what operand/result introduced a
   sharding on some op result.
### `-sdy-op-priority-propagate`

_Runs the op-priority propagation algorithm._

Propagates shardings in iterations, based on a set of op heuristics. Each
heuristic determines whether to propagate in forward, backward, or both
directions for a given op.

This starts at op-priority 0 and increases until all op heuristics have been
exhausted and the program has reached a fixed-point.

For a priority p, all op heuristics are considered from 0 <= i < p. The most
expressive direction is chosen for each op, with
`BOTH > BACKWARD == FORWARD > NONE`. If during this iteration,
`FORWARD`/`BACKWARD` is seen first then `BACKWARD`/`FORWARD` is seen, the
 direction is `BOTH`.

This propagation strategy extends the aggressive propagation strategy, which
means that at each op-priority iteration, a full aggressive propagation is
applied (see `AggressivePropagationPass`).

**Options:**
- `-keep-sharding-rules`: whether to keep existing and created op sharding
   rules.
- `-module-dump-directory`: where to dump any rewritten modules for debugging.
- `-conservative-propagation`: whether to disallow split axes and non-divisible
   sharding axes during propagation.
- `-debug-sharding-origins`: whether to save information about the origin of a
   sharding on the MLIR module. These would be the shardings on the function
   inputs, outputs, sharding constraints and manual computations before
   propagation.
- `-debug-edge-source-sharding`: whether to save information about the edge source
   of a sharding on the MLIR module. These are what operand/result introduced a
   sharding on some op result.
- `-propagation-strategy`: which factor propagation strategy to use.
- `-run-op-priority-propagation`: whether to run (or skip) op-priority
   propagation.
### `-sdy-populate-op-sharding-rules`

_Populates all registered ops with an `OpShardingRuleAttr`._

Populates all registered ops with an `OpShardingRuleAttr`, which is used for
debugging/testing the registered sharding rules. Propagation already does
this just-in-time, but this pass does it all at once.

#### Options
```
-conservative-propagation : whether to disllow rules that can propagate non-divisible sharding axes
```
### `-sdy-user-priority-propagate`

_Runs the user-priority propagation algorithm._

Propagates shardings in iterations, starting from the highest priority
(lowest number, normally p0) to the lowest priority (highest number). In
other words, at the i-th iteration, only dimension shardings with priority
<=i are propagated.

This propagation strategy extends the op-priority propagation strategy,
which means that at each user-priority iteration, a full op-priority
propagation is applied (see `OpPriorityPropagationPass`).

**Options:**
- `-keep-sharding-rules`: whether to keep existing and created op sharding
   rules.
- `-module-dump-directory`: where to dump any rewritten modules for debugging.
- `-conservative-propagation`: whether to disallow split axes and non-divisible
   sharding axes during propagation.
- `-debug-sharding-origins`: whether to save information about the origin of a
   sharding on the MLIR module. These would be the shardings on the function
   inputs, outputs, sharding constraints and manual computations before
   propagation.
- `-debug-edge-source-sharding`: whether to save information about the edge source
   of a sharding on the MLIR module. These are what operand/result introduced a
   sharding on some op result.
- `-propagation-strategy`: which factor propagation strategy to use.
- `-run-op-priority-propagation`: whether to run (or skip) op-priority
   propagation.
